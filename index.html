        <h1>Welcome to Mars!</h1>
        <div>
            <p>My name is Gorge. No, not George--<emphasis>gorge</emphasis>--as in, "Yes I know I'm so gooooorgeous, and
                btw you're looking fab, too." Anyhoo, I'll be your tour guide while you're here.</p>
            <p>The first thing you simply must know is how to play Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock. You see, we
                like to keep this a secret off-world, but we make most of our decisions through a process of elimination
                by playing it. Funnily enough, though "Rock, Paper, Scissors" was imported from Earth eons ago, you
                Earthlings never seem to have caught on to our improved method, which results in fewer ties (and is fun
                with more
                players, too). We'd be insulted but we've come to realize that the rules may simply be too complex for
                the average Earthling, at least judging from the cognitive testing you put your supreme leaders through.
                What was it, "person, woman, man, camera, TV"? Sad.</p>
            <p>Instead of giving you the rules of game, I decided to create a little practice game for you. Each time
                you play a round against the computer, the relevant rule will display.
                Don't worry. If you want to keep playing after you've learned the rules, you can just reset the scores
                back to zero to start afresh. For now, you'll be playing against the computer. But just wait until you
                get to play against one of us! Better hurry up and learn, though, you'll be needing this skill
                throughout your travels, more than you know, my friend!
            </p>
            <p>So here goes. Please enter a player name. No one here uses their real name, so make it a good one.</p>
