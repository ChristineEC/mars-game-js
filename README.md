## A learning game of rock, paper, scissors, lizard, Spock
### Written with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### Description

In this game, the user is a newly arrived tourist on Mars. The game is introduced as a way to teach the visitor the rules of the game of Rock, Paper Scissors, Lizard, Spock through active play. The game enables the user to play against the computer and learn the rules as they go along. They can reset the scoreboard anytime they like, so after they learn the rules they can start keeping score anew. The tone of the game is lightly humorous, encouraging, for example, the user to enter a fun user name instead of a real name. Default text is kept to a minimum in line with the game's purpose, which is to entertain and teach the rules of the game, but the user can learn more about the game by choosing to reveal a paragraph that can be displayed and then hidden, if desired. Credit for the invention of the game is given there, under the button "About Game."

### Features
The game has three main sections, the introduction and greeting section, the game section, and the results and scoring section.

#### Introduction and Greeting
The introduction section gives a very brief introduction to the game and tells the user it is intended to teach them the rules. There are three interactive features in this section. First, an About Game button, which when clicked reveals a longer paragraph on the origins of the game and some light humor concerning the (lack of) intelligence of Earthlings based on the cognitive test we give our supreme leaders. The longer paragraph can be hidden with a button that says "Hide" so that users playing on smaller screens can still see the game in the window without scrolling.
Another interactive feature is the light and dark toggle switch,
